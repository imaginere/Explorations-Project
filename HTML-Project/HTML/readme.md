## Code in this project

HTML5 and XML Scent & Smell tag: 

I have tried to use mainly HTML 5 tags.
Used code snippets and help from w3 School as I did not know all the syntax and parameters needed.

XML of Smell and Scent Tag:

This is a Speculative version of a HTML 6 smell & Scent tag in the possible future, when browsers and devices can detect smells and collect it from users for analysis.
